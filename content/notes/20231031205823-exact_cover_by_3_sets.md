## Problem Definition {#problem-definition}

Given a set \\(U\\) with \\(|U| = 3n\\) and a collection \\(C\\) of 3-element subsets of \\(U\\). Does \\(C\\) contain an exact cover for \\(U\\), that is, a subcollection \\(C^{\prime} \subset C\\) such that every element of \\(U\\) occurs in exactly one member of \\(C^{\prime}\\)?
