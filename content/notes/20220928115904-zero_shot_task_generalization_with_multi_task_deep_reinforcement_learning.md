This paper proposes a hierarchical RL architecture which consists of two modules: one meta controller for generate next subtask's parameters <span class="underline">by reading the subtask's instruction</span>; and one parameterized skill policy model to generalized in different picking tasks by using analogy-making methods.

Still by giving an instruction or sequence to do all subtasks.
