-   Definition: A <span class="underline">membership function</span> ranges from `0-1`, with a larger vlue indicating a higher degree of truth.

-   Union: max

-   Intersection: min

-   Relation: a fuzzy set \\(R(X, Y)\\) defined on the Cartesian product of crisp sets

-   Composition: \\(B(Y) = A(X) \circle R(X, Y)\\)
    -   \\(R(X, Y) \circle S(Y, Z) = \max \min [\mu\_R(x, y), \mu\_S(y, z)]\\)

-   General Extension Principle: max min

-   Mamdani Implication: \\(\sigma(a, b) = min[a, b]\\)

-   Represent of rules: For all inputs, take the "min" and "max" operation according to the rule statements

-   Defuzzification: center-of-area (COA) \\(= \frac{\sum u\_i \mu(u\_i)}{\sum \mu(u\_i)}\\)
