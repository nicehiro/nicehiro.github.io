This paper propose to use three criterion for quantifying the uncertainty of MLLMs, namely <span class="underline">token probability</span>, <span class="underline">entropy</span>, and <span class="underline">self-explained confidence</span>.

I'm not quite sure the difference between token probability and token entropy. I think those are same thing.

Anyway, this paper may provide one aspect of what I want to do.
