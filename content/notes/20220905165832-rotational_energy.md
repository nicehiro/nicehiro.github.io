Rotational energy is kinetic energy due to the rotation of an object and is part of its total kinetic energy.

\begin{equation\*}
\mathcal{E} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2
\end{equation\*}

where \\(I\\) is the [Moment of Inertia]({{< relref "20220905170405-moment_of_inertia.md" >}}) and \\(\omega\\) is the angular velocity.
