Same idea with [Skew-Fit: State-Covering Self-Supervised Reinforcement Learning]({{< relref "20221121172110-skew_fit_state_covering_self_supervised_reinforcement_learning.md" >}}). Trying to maximize the distribution of less visited archived goals, that is  also the idea of maximize the entropy of \\(H(S)\\).

<span class="underline">But the structure of subgoal exploration algorithm organized by this paper is really great.</span>
