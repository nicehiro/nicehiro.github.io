## Compile &amp; Link {#compile-and-link}

```nil
Source file (C, C++) -> Object file (.o, .obj) -> Library (Archive) file (.a, .lib)
```

Source file can be **compiled** to object file, and the compiler only check grammer and definition of function. Then the linker will **link** object file to library file by finding all needed functions from object files.


## Basic Rule {#basic-rule}

```makefile
target ... : prerequisites ...
    command
    ...
    ...
```
