Swift structures and classes are **much closer** in functionality than in
other languages.


## Comparing {#comparing}


### Common {#common}

-   Properties to store values.
-   Methods to provide functionality.
-   Access to their values using subscript syntax(下标操作).
-   Initializers to set up their initial state.
-   Be **extended** to expand their functionality beyond a default implementation.
-   Conform to protocols to provide standard functionality of a certain kind.


### Different {#different}


#### Structures {#structures}


#### Classes {#classes}

-   Reference counting allows **more than one** reference to a class instance.
-   Inheritance enables one class to inherit the characteristics of another.
-   Deinitializers(析构器) enable an instance of a class to free up any resources
    it has assigned.
