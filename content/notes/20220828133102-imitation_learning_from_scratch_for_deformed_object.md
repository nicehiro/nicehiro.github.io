Imitation learning from scratch rather than using Simulation to Real ways to learn a policy to control deformed object.

Simulation is still important. What different is we do not use some policies or models generated by simulation process, we just use simulation to estimate our ideas. Then do it again in real world.

Hopefully, there will be less training time if we do imitation great and can directly learn by the robot itself.


## Plan {#plan}


### Find papers about imitation learning in robotics {#find-papers-about-imitation-learning-in-robotics}


### check if this is worked {#check-if-this-is-worked}
