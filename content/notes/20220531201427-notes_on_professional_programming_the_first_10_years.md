Thorsten Ball is a 10 year professional programmer. This unordered collection of thoughts were what he learned in the past 10 years. I think it is valuable for me to learn some thing from it.


## Fearlessness {#fearlessness}

Try to be more Fearlessness when we first meet a bunch of codes or a new area which you never seen before. Becoming fearless is one of the best learning accelerators.


## Write tests that give you confidence that the system works as it should {#write-tests-that-give-you-confidence-that-the-system-works-as-it-should}

I'm not someone who really care about to write a fully-concered test for my code. That is not right. I think this is possiblly because I don't work in a big company before and I don't have the fare of rework what you have done.

I will try to write test for my code in the future.


## Sharpen the axe, but don't overdo it {#sharpen-the-axe-but-don-t-overdo-it}

Always sharpen your configurations of your favorate text editors is really interesting and also important. But overdo it!

Keep your main energy on something really urgent, like reading or learning new knowledge.


## Rolling up their sleeves because it has to get done {#rolling-up-their-sleeves-because-it-has-to-get-done}

Do something not for money or fun, just because someone has to do it.


## Still love programming very much {#still-love-programming-very-much}

Me too.
