For a point mass the moment of inertia is simply the mass times the square of the perpendicular distance to the axis of rotation.

\begin{equation\*}
I = m r^2
\end{equation\*}

For a rigid composite system the moment of inertia is the sum of the moments of inertia of its component subsystems.

\begin{equation\*}
I = \iint \rho r^2 dV
\end{equation\*}

    > Rotational energy is kinetic energy due to the rotation of an object and is part of its total kinetic energy.
-   [Torque]({{< relref "20220905195136-torque.md" >}})

    > Torque is a measure of force that can cause an object to rotate about an axis. Just as force is what causes an object to accelerate in linear kinematics, torque is what causes an object to acquire angular acceleration.
