-   [Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient]({{< relref "20210531135316-deep_deterministic_policy_gradient.md" >}})

    >   DDPG, short for **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient**, is a model-free off-policy
    > actor-critic algorithm, combining [Deterministic Policy Gradient]({{< relref "20210530130547-deterministic_policy_gradient.md" >}})
    > and [DQN]({{< relref "20210531140718-dqn.md" >}}).
    > Recall that DQN stabilizes learning of Q-function by experience replay buffer
    > and the frozen target network. The original DQN works in discrete space, and
    > DDPG extends it to continuous space with the actor-critic framework while
    > learning a deterministic policy.
