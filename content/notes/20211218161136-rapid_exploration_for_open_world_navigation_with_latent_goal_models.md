A robotic learning system must be robust to

1.  the difference between an offline training dataset and the real world,
2.  non-stationary changes in the real world(ignore visual distractors).

They consider the problem of navigating to a user-specified goal in a
previously unseen environment.

Broadly, their method, Rapid Exploration Controller for Outcome-driven
Navigation(RECON) consists of three separate stages:

1.  learning a subgoal representation using Deep Variational Information Bottleneck
    architecture from offline data,
2.  Using subgoals generated by previous trained goal model for data
    collection(new environment) and building a map in a new environment,
3.  navigating to subgoals in the new environment.

Notice that the exploration and navigation is executing at the same time.
